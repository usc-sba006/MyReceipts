    Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=EA:0F:B7:E2:5F:66:D7:8D:70:87:5D:AD:74:9D:D9:A3:20:77:31:96%3Bcom.bignerdranch.android.myreceipts

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    EA:0F:B7:E2:5F:66:D7:8D:70:87:5D:AD:74:9D:D9:A3:20:77:31:96

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    EA:0F:B7:E2:5F:66:D7:8D:70:87:5D:AD:74:9D:D9:A3:20:77:31:96

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

        List of alternative API keys:
        AIzaSyCpOCxsPbl-tXlRIV4nzhnRibIYymdznfY      - The key provided in the Week 11 Lab notes, the only one that consistently works.
        AIzaSyCKO9De9ty7ZZtb0VMC3ct51wCZEFxWaOk      - 1st attempt, never worked.
        AIzaSyDLab9aQINgn-ncONMeH5CrOjWNBMKk1jE      - 2nd attempt, worked temporarily and then stopped working. Seems to be the key with the best chance of working out of the three attempts.
        AIzaSyDSBidScVezcMsXdOK-IbxJKjn6XkDQrt0      - 3rd attempt, never worked.
